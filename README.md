# Ivy-League-Football

## About the project
---
I scraped Ivy League football game data from Wikipedia and made an interactive figure to visualize the data. Readers can select a line in the figure, which will then be highlighted and labeled. The details are documented along with the code in the Jupyter notebook file.

## Getting started
---
I used Jupyter notebook for this project. Run the `ipynb` file locally to interact with the figure or see the `html` file to see the static version of it. \
To install Jupyter notebook, one can do so with [conda or pip](https://jupyter.org/install), but I found it neat to use the package management tool [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
